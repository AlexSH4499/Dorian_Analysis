Optional:

setup a virtualenvironment before installing requirements.txt
this can be done with Python's included venv package or with the module virtualenv

-- for this project virtualenv was utilized

virtualenv {ENV}

*{} insert whatever name for the environment

to activate it use on linux:

source /path/to/ENV/bin/activate

once it has been run successfully your path in the terminal should look something like this

({ENV})user@{local_machine}:~/Path/To/Project$
--------------------------------

Now to install the dependencies run:(This assumes the user is in the root directory of the project)

python3 -m pip3 install -r requirements.txt


--------------------------

Must run this to allow plotting on  linux machines:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
